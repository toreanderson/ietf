                 draft-anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat-00

Abstract

   This document describes an extension of the SIIT-DC
   [I-D.anderson-siit-dc] architecture, which allows applications that
   are incompatible with SIIT and/or Network Address Translation in
   general to operate correctly in an SIIT-DC environment.

   The reader is expected to be familiar with the general SIIT-DC
   architecture described in [I-D.anderson-siit-dc].

1.  Introduction

   SIIT-DC [I-D.anderson-siit-dc] describes an architecture where
   IPv4-only users can access IPv6-only services through a stateless
   translation gateway.  However, this only works for applications that
   are compatible with Network Address Translation (NAT), due to the
   fact that the SIIT gateway will rewrite the addresses in the IP
   header as part of the translation process.  SIIT-DC will also fail to
   work correctly for applications that make use of legacy IPv4-only
   socket calls.

   This document aims to remedy this problem by defining an extension to
   SIIT-DC.  Translation performed by the SIIT gateway will also be done
   in reverse by a host agent running on the server.  The resulting IPv4
   packet is then passed to the application.  This way, the application
   will be able to use legacy IPv4-only socket calls and/or include
   references to its own IPv4 address in the application payload, while
   maintaining correct operation.

   The approach is heavily inspired by and very similar to 464XLAT
   [RFC6877].  The described SIIT host agent in this document is almost
   identical to the CLAT agent described by 464XLAT, except for the fact
   that it will be located on a server, rather than on the customer-side
   node.  The SIIT gateway described in [I-D.anderson-siit-dc] is used
   instead of the PLAT described by 464XLAT.

2.  SIIT Host Agent Specification

   The SIIT host agent runs on the servers hosting application which do
   not work correctly with the SIIT-DC architecture as specified by
   [I-D.anderson-siit-dc].  Its task is the performing the exact same
   packet translation as the SIIT gateway, but in reverse.  It therefore
   shares the same implementation requirements as the SIIT gateway
   defined in I-D.anderson-siit-dc section 4 [I-D.anderson-siit-dc],
   with one exception: The SIIT host agent is not required to support
   configuring an arbitrary number of static mappings, but it must
   support at least one.

   The SIIT host agent must be configured with a static IPv4:IPv6
   mapping that corresponds exactly with the same mapping found on the
   SIIT gateway.  The IPv4 address must be configured on a virtual
   network interface which applications running on the server can bind
   to, and the server is expected to install a default IPv4 route
   poining to this virtual IPv4 interface.  The IPv6 address must be a
   secondary address that is routed to the server and dedicated to the
   SIIT host agent function.

3.  Architectural Overview

   The following figure shows how an application (that is presumably
   incompatible with SIIT-DC) is being made available to the IPv4
   Internet on the IPv4 address 198.51.0.2.  The application will be
   able to know that this is its local address and thus be able to
   provide correct references to it in application payload.

   The figure also shows how the same application is available over IPv6
   on the address 2001:db8:12:34::2.  This is included to illustrate how
   native IPv6 connectivity is not impacted by the SIIT host agent, and
   also to illustrate how the address assigned to the SIIT host agent
   (2001:db8:12:34::3) is separate from the primary IPv6 address of the
   server.  It is however important to note that the application in
   question does not have to be dual-stack capable at all.  IPv4-only
   applications would also be able to operate behind a SIIT host agent
   in the exact same manner.

   Note that the figure below could be considered a more detailed view
   of Customer A's FTP server from the example topology figure in
   appendix A [I-D.anderson-siit-dc].  Both figures intentionally use
   the exact same example IP addresses.

4.  Deployment Considerations

4.1.  IPv6 Path MTU

   The IPv6 Path MTU between the SIIT host agent and the SIIT gateway
   will typically be larger than the default value defined in section 4
   of RFC6145 [RFC6145] (1280), as it will typically contained within a
   single administrative domain.  Therefore, it is recommended that the
   IPv6 Path MTU configured in the SIIT-HA is raised accordingly.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the SIIT host agent and the SIIT gateway use
   identical configured IPv6 Path MTU values.

4.2.  IPv4 MTU

   In order to avoid fragmentation, it is RECOMMENDED that the virtual
   IPv4 interface is configured with an MTU value identical to the
   configured IPv6 Path MTU - 20.  This ensures that the application may
   do its part in avoiding IP-level fragmentation from occurring, e.g.,
   by segmenting/fragmenting outbound packets at the application layer,
   and advertising the maximum size its peer may use for inbound packets
   (e.g., through the use of the TCP MSS option).

Internet-Draft                SIIT-DC-2XLAT                  August 2014


   This draft makes no request of the IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   This section discussues security considerations specific to the use
   of a SIIT host agent.  See the Security Considerations in I-D
   .anderson-siit-dc [I-D.anderson-siit-dc] for additional security
   considerations applicable to the SIIT architecture in general.

8.1.  Address Spoofing

   If the SIIT host agent receives an IPv4 packet from the application
   from a different source address than the one it has a static mapping
   for, the both the source and destination addresses will be rewritten
   according to [RFC6052].  After undergoing the reverse translation in
   the SIIT gateway, the resulting IPv4 packet routed to the IPv4
   network will have a spoofed IPv4 source address.  The SIIT host agent
   should therefore ensure that ingress filtering (cf. BCP38 [RFC2827]
   is used on the SIIT host agent's IPv4 interface, so that such packets
   are immediately discarded.

   If the SIIT host agent receives an IPv6 packet with both the source
   and destination address equal to the one it has a static mapping
   from, the resulting packet would appear to the application as locally
   generated, as both the source address and the destination address
   will be the same address as the one configured on the virtual IPv4
   interface.  This could trick the application into thinking this
   packet came from a trusted source, and give elevated privileges
   accordingly.  To prevent this, the SIIT host agent should discard any
   received IPv6 packets that have a source address that is equal either
   to either the IPv4 (after undergoing [RFC6052] translation) or the
   IPv6 address in the static mapping.
