    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
      SIIT-DC is an extension of <xref target="RFC6145">SIIT</xref> that
      provides a network-centric stateless translation service that allows a
      data centre operator or Internet Content Provider (ICP) to run a data
      centre network, servers, and applications using exclusively IPv6, while
      at the same time ensuring that end users that have only IPv4
      connectivity will be able to continue to access the services and
      applications.
      </t>
      <section title="Motivation and Goals">
        <t>
        Historically, <xref target="RFC4213">dual stack</xref> has been the
        recommended way to transition from an IPv4-only environment to one
        capable of serving IPv6 users. For data centre operators and Internet
        content providers, dual stack operation has a number of disadvantages
        compared to single stack operation. In particular, running two
        protocols rather than one results in increased complexity and
        operational overhead, with a very low expected return on investment in
        the short to medium term, as there are practically no end-users who
        have only connectivity to the IPv6 Internet. Furthermore, the dual
        stack approach does not in any way help with the depletion of the IPv4
        address space.
        </t>
        <t>
        Therefore, a better approach is needed. The design goals are:
        </t>
        <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Promote the deployment of native IPv6 services (cf. <xref
          target="RFC6540"/>).</t>
          <t>Provide IPv4 service availability for legacy users with no loss
          of performance or functionality.</t>
          <t>To ensure that that the legacy users' IPv4 addresses remain
          available to the servers and applications.</t>
          <t>To conserve and maximise the utilisation of IPv4 addresses.</t>
          <t>To avoid introducing more complexity than absolutely necessary,
          especially on the servers and applications.</t>
          <t>To be easy to scale and deploy in a fault-tolerant manner.</t>
        </list>
        </t>
        <t>
        The following subsections elaborates on how SIIT-DC meets these goals.
        </t>
        <section title="Single Stack IPv6 Operation">
          <t>
          SIIT-DC allows an operator to build their applications on an
          IPv6-only foundation. IPv4 end-user connectivity becomes a service
          provided by the network, which systems administration and
          application development staff do not need to concern themselves
          with.
          </t>
          <t>
          Obviously, this will promote universal IPv6 deployment for all of
          the provider's services and applications.
          </t>
          <t>
          It is worth noting that SIIT-DC requires no special support or
          change from the underlying IPv6 infrastructure, it will work with
          any kind of IPv6 network. Traffic between IPv6-enabled end users and
          IPv6-enabled services will always be native, and SIIT-DC will not be
          involved in it at all.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Stateless Operation">
          <t>
          Unlike other solutions that provide either dual stack availability
          to single-stack services (e.g., <xref target="RFC6146">Stateful
          NAT64</xref> and Layer-4/7 proxies), or that provide conservation of
          IPv4 addresses (e.g., <xref target="RFC3022">NAPT44</xref>), a
          SIIT-DC Gateway does not keep any state between each packet in a
          single connection or flow. In this sense it operates exactly like a
          normal IP router, and has similar scaling properties - the limiting
          factors are packets per second and bandwidth. The number of
          concurrent flows and flow initiation rates are irrelevant for
          performance.
          </t>
          <t>
          This not only allows individual SIIT-DC Gateways to easily attain
          "line rate" performance, it also allows for per-packet load
          balancing between multiple SIIT-DC Gateways using <xref
          target="RFC2991">Equal-Cost Multipath Routing</xref>. Asymmetric
          routing is also acceptable, which makes it easy to avoid sub-optimal
          traffic patterns; the prefixes involved may be anycasted from all
          the SIIT-DC Gateways in the provider's network, thus ensuring that
          the most optimal path through the network is used, even where the
          optimal path in one direction differs from the optimal path in the
          opposite direction.
          </t>
          <t>
          Finally, stateless operation means that high availability is easily
          achieved. If an SIIT-DC Gateway should fail, its traffic can be
          re-routed onto another SIIT-DC Gateway using a standard IP routing
          protocol. This does not impact existing flows any more than what any
          other IP re-routing event would.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="IPv4 Address Conservation">
          <t>
          In most parts of the world, it is difficult or even impossible to
          obtain generously sized IPv4 allocations from the Regional Internet
          Registries. The resulting scarcity in turn impacts individual end
          users and operators, which might be forced to purchase IPv4
          addresses from other operators in order to cover their needs. This
          process can be risky to business continuity, in the case no suitable
          block for sale can be located, and/or turn out to be prohibitively
          expensive. Even so, a data centre operator will find that providing
          IPv4 service is essential, as a large share of the Internet users
          still does not have IPv6 connectivity.
          </t>
          <t>
          A key goal of SIIT-DC is to help reduce a data centre operator's
          IPv4 address requirement to the absolute minimum, by allowing the
          operator to remove them entirely from components that do not need to
          communicate with endpoints in the IPv4 Internet. One example would
          be servers that are operating in a supporting/backend role and only
          communicates with to other servers (database servers, file servers,
          and so on). Another example would be the network infrastructure
          itself (router-to-router links, loopback addresses, and so on).
          Furthermore, as LAN prefix sizes must always be rounded up to the
          nearest power of two (or larger, if one reserves space for future
          growth), even more IPv4 addresses will often end up being wasted
          without even being used.
          </t>
          <t>
          With SIIT-DC, the operator can remove these valuable IPv4 addresses
          from his backend servers and network infrastructure, and reassign
          them to the SIIT-DC service as IPv4 Service Addresses. There is no
          requirement that IPv4 Service Addresses are assigned in an
          aggregated manner, so there is nothing lost due to infrastructure
          overhead; every single IPv4 address assigned to SIIT-DC can be used
          an IPv4 Service Address.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="No Loss of End User's IPv4 Source Address">
          <t>
          SIIT-DC will map the entire end-user's IPv4 source address into an
          predefined IPv6 translation prefix. This ensures that there is no
          loss of information; the end-user's IPv4 source address remains
          available to the server/application, allowing it to perform tasks
          like Geo-Location, logging, abuse handling, and so forth.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Compatible with Standard IPv6 Implementations">
          <t>
          Except for the introduction of the SIIT-DC Gateways themselves, no
          change to the network, servers, applications, or anything else is
          required in order to support SIIT-DC. SIIT-DC is practically
          invisibible from the point of view of the the IPv4 clients, the IPv6
          servers, the IPv6 data centre network, and the IPv4 Internet.
          SIIT-DC interoperates with all standards-compliant IPv4 or IPv6
          stacks.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="No Architectural Dependency on IPv4">
          <t>
          SIIT-DC will allow an ICP or data centre operator to build
          infrastructure and applications entirely on IPv6. This means that
          when the day comes to discontinue support for IPv4, no change needs
          to be made to the overall architecture - it's only a matter of
          shutting off the SIIT-DC Gateways. Therefore, by deploying native
          IPv6 along with SIIT-DC, operators will avoid future migration or
          deployment projects relating to IPv6 roll-out and/or IPv4
          sun-setting.

       <t hangText="IPv4 Service Address Pool">One or more IPv4 prefixes
       routed to the SIIT-DC Gateway's IPv4 interface. IPv4 Service Addresses

       to be a "pool" per se, as it could also be one or more host routes
       (whose prefix length is equal to /32). The primary purpose of using a
       pool rather than host routes is to facilitate IPv4 route aggregation
       and ease provisioning of new IPv4 Service Addresses.</t>
       <t hangText="IPv6 Service Address">A public IPv6 address assigned to a
       server or application in the IPv6 network. IPv6-only and dual stacked

      <t>
      In this example, 192.0.2.0/24 is allocated as an IPv4 Service Address
      Pool. Individual IPv4 Service Addresses are assigned from this pool.
      The provider must route this prefix to the SIIT-DC Gateway's IPv4
      interface. Note that there are no restrictions on how many IPv4 Service
      Address Pools are used or their prefix length, as long as they are all
      routed to the SIIT-DC Gateway's IPv4 interface.
      </t>
      <t>
      The Static Address Mapping list is used when translating an IPv4 Service
      Address (here 192.0.2.1) to its corresponding IPv6 Service Address (here
      2001:db8:12:34::1) and vice versa. When the SIIT-DC Gateway translates
      an IPv4 packet to IPv6, any IPv4 Service Address found in the original
      IPv4 header will be replaced with the corresponding IPv6 Service Address
      in the resulting IPv6 header, and vice versa when translating an IPv6
      packet to IPv4.
      </t>
      <t>
      2001:db8:46::/96 is the Translation Prefix into which the entire IPv4
      address space is mapped. It is used for translation of the end user's
      IPv4 address to IPv6 and vice versa according to the algorithm defined
      in <xref target="RFC6052">Section 2.2 of RFC6052</xref>. This
      algorithmic mapping has a lower precedence than the configured Static
      Address Mappings.
      </t>
      <t>
      The SIIT-DC Gateway itself can be either a separate device or a logical
      function in another multi-purpose device, for example an IP router. Any
      number of SIIT-DC Gateways may exist simultaneously in an operators
      infrastructure, as long as they all have the same translation prefix and
      list of Static Mappings configured.

      <section title="DNS Configuration">
        <t>
        The IPv6 Service Address of should be registered in DNS using an AAAA
        record, while its corresponding IPv4 Service Address should be
        registered using an A record. This results in the following DNS
        records:

        In this example, "IPv4-only user" initiates a request to the

        This time, the source address matched the Static Address Mapping and

        The resulting IPv4 packet is transmitted back to the end user over the

        communicating with an IPv4 client. To them, it's just plain IPv4 or
        IPv6, respectively. However, the applications running on the server
        may optionally be updated to recognise and strip the Translation
        Prefix, so that the end user's IPv4 address may be used for logging,
        Geo-Location, abuse handling, and so forth.

    <section title="Deployment Guidelines">
      <t>
      In this section, we list recommendations and guidelines for operators
      who would like to deploy a SIIT-DC service in their data centre network.
      </t>
      <section title="Application Support for NAT">
        <t>
        Not all application protocols are able to operate in a network
        environment where rewriting of IP addresses occur. An operator should
        therefore carefully evaluate the applications he would like to make
        available for IPv4 users through SIIT-DC, to ensure they do not fall
        in this category. In general, if an application layer protocol works
        correctly through standard NAT44 (see <xref target="RFC3235"/>), it
        will most likely work correctly through SIIT-DC as well.
        </t>
        <t>
        Higher-level protocols that embed IP addresses as part of their
        payload are especially problematic, as noted in <xref
        target="RFC2663"/>, <xref target="RFC2993"/>, and <xref
        target="RFC3022"/>. Such protocols will most likely not work through
        any form of address translation, including SIIT-DC. One well-known
        example of such a protocol is <xref target="RFC0959">FTP</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
        The SIIT-DC architecture may be extended with a Host Agent that
        reverses the translation performed by the SIIT-DC Gateway before
        passing the packets to the application software. This allows the
        problematic application protocols described above to work correctly in
        an SIIT-DC environment as well. See <xref
        target="I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat"/> for a description of this
        extension.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Application Support for IPv6">
        <t>
        SIIT-DC requires that the application software supports IPv6
        networking, and that it has no dependency on IPv4 networking. If this
        is not the case, the approach described in <xref
        target="I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat"/> may be used, as it
        provides the application with seemingly native IPv4 connectivity. This
        allows IPv4-only applications to work correctly in an otherwise
        IPv6-only environment.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Application Communication Pattern">
        <t>
        SIIT-DC is ideally suited for applications where IPv4-only nodes on
        the Internet initiate traffic towards the IPv6-only services, which in
        turn are only passively listening for inbound traffic and responding
        as necessary. One well-known example of such a protocol is  <xref
        target="RFC2616">HTTP</xref>. This is due to the fact that in this
        case, an IPv4 user looks exactly like an ordinary IPv6 user from the
        host and application's point of view, and requires no special
        treatment.
        </t>
        <t>
        It is possible to combine SIIT-DC with <xref
        target="RFC6147">DNS64</xref> in order to allow an IPv6-only
        application to initiate communication with IPv4-only nodes through an
        SIIT-DC Gateway. However, in this case, care must be taken so that all
        outgoing communication is sourced from the IPv6 Service Address that
        has a Static Mapping configured on the SIIT-DC Gateway. If another
        unmapped address is used, the SIIT-DC Gateway will discard the packet.
        </t>
        <t>
        An alternative approach to the above would be to make use of an
        SIIT-DC Host Agent as described in <xref
        target="I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat"/>. This provides the
        application with seemingly native IPv4 connectivity, which it may use
        for both inbound and outbound communication without requiring the
        application to select a specific source address for its outbound
        communications.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Choice of Translation Prefix">
        <t>
        Either a Network-Specific Prefix (NSP) from the provider's own IPv6
        address space or the IANA-allocated Well-Known Prefix 64:ff9b::/96
        (WKP) may be used. From a technical point of view, both should work
        equally well, however as only a single WKP exists, if a provider would
        like to deploy more than one instance of SIIT-DC in his network, or
        <xref target="RFC6146">Stateful NAT64</xref>, an NSP must be used
        anyway for all but one of those deployments.
        </t>
        <t>
        Furthermore, the WKP cannot be used in inter-domain routing. By using
        an NSP, a provider will have the possibility to provide SIIT-DC
        service to other operators across Autonomous System borders.
        </t>
        <t>
        For these reasons, this document recommends that an NSP is used.
        Section 3.3 of <xref target="RFC6052"/> discusses the choice of
        translation prefix in more detail.
        </t>
        <t>
        The Translation Prefix may use any of the lengths described in <xref
        target="RFC6052">Section 2.2 of RFC6052</xref>, but /96 has two
        distinct advantages over the others. First, converting it to IPv4 can
        be done in a single operation by simply stripping off the first 96
        bits; second, it allows for IPv4 addresses to be embedded directly
        into the text representation of an IPv6 address using the familiar
        dotted quad notation, e.g., "2001:db8::198.51.100.10" (cf. <xref
        target="RFC6052">Section 2.4 of RFC6052</xref>)), instead of being
        converted to hexadecimal notation. This makes it easier to write IPv6
        ACLs and similar that match translated endpoints in the IPv4 Internet.
        Use of a /96 prefix length is therefore recommended.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Routing Considerations">
        <t>
        The prefixes that constitute the IPv4 Service Address Pool and the
        IPv6 Translation Prefix may be routed to the SIIT-DC Gateway(s) as any
        other IPv4 or IPv6 route in the provider's network.
        </t>
        <t>
        If more than one SIIT-DC Gateway is being deployed, it is recommended
        that a dynamic routing protocol (such as BGP, IS-IS, or OSPF) is being
        used to advertise the routes within the provider's network. This will
        ensure that the traffic that is to be translated will reach the
        closest SIIT-DC Gateway, reducing or eliminating sub-optimal traffic
        patterns, as well as provide high availability - if one SIIT-DC
        Gateway fails, the dynamic routing protocol will automatically
        redirect the traffic to the next-best translator.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Location of the SIIT-DC Gateways">
        <t>
        The goal of SIIT-DC is to facilitate a true IPv6-only application and
        network architecture, with the sole exception being the IPv4
        interfaces of the SIIT-DC Gateways and the network infrastructure
        required to connect them to the IPv4 Internet. Therefore, the SIIT-DC
        Gateways should be located somewhere beween the IPv4 Internet and the
        application delivery stack. This should be understood to include all
        servers, load balancers, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and
        similar devices that are processing traffic to a greater extent than
        merely forwarding it.
        </t>
        <t>
        It is optimal to place the SIIT-DC Gateways as close as possible to
        the direct path between the servers and the end users. If the closest
        translator is located a long way from the optimal path, all packets in
        both directions must make a detour. This would increase the RTT
        between the server and the end user by by two times the extra latency
        incurred by the detour, as well as cause unnecessary load on the
        network links on the detour path.
        </t>
        <t>
        Where possible, it is beneficial to implement the SIIT-DC Gateways as
        a logical function within the routers would have handled the traffic
        anyway, had the topology been dual stacked. This way, the translation
        service would not need to be assigned separate networks ports (which
        might become saturated and impact the service quality), nor would it
        require extra rack space and energy. Some particularly good choices of
        the location could be within a data centre's access routers, or within
        the provider's border routers. When every single application in the
        data centre or the provider's network eventually runs on single-stack
        IPv6, there would no need to run IPv4 on the inside of the SIIT-DC
        Gateway. This reduces complexity, and allows the operator to reclaim
        IPv4 addresses from the network infrastructure that may instead be
        used as IPv4 Service Address Pools.
        </t>
        <t>
        Finally, another possibility is that the data centre operator
        outsources the SIIT-DC service to another entity, for example his
        upstream ISP. Doing so allows the data centre operator to build a true
        IPv6-only infrastructure. However, in this case, care must be taken to
        ensure that the path between the data centre and the SIIT-DC operator
        has a stable and known MTU, and that the SIIT-DC Gateways are not too
        far away from the data centre (otherwise, translated traffic could
        incur a latency penalty).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Migration from Dual Stack">
        <t>
        While this document discusses the use of IPv6-only servers and
        applications, there is no technical requirement that the servers are
        IPv4 free. SIIT-DC works equally well for dual stacked servers, which
        makes migration easy - after setting up the translation function, the
        DNS A record for the service is updated to point to the IPv4 address
        that will be translated to IPv6, the previously used IPv4 service
        address may continue to be assigned to the server. This makes
        roll-back to dual stack easy, as it is only a matter of changing the
        DNS record back to what it was before.
        </t>
        <t>
        For high-volume services migrating to SIIT-DC from dual stack, DNS
        Round Robin may be used to gradually migrate the service's IPv4
        traffic from its native IPv4 address(es) to the translated IPv4
        Service Address(s).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Packet Size and Fragmentation Considerations">
        <t>
        There are some key differences between IPv4 and IPv6 relating to
        packet sizes and fragmentation that one should consider when deploying
        SIIT-DC. They result in a few problematic corner cases, which can be
        dealt with in a few different ways. The following subsections will
        discuss these in detail, and provide operational guidance.
        </t>
        <t>
        In particular, the operator may find that relying on fragmentation in
        the IPv6 domain is undesired or even operationally impossible <xref
        target="I-D.taylor-v6ops-fragdrop"/>.  For this reason, the
        recommendations in this section seeks to minimise the use of IPv6
        fragmentation.
        </t>
        <t>
        Unless otherwise stated, the following subsections assume that the MTU
        in both the IPv4 and IPv6 domains is 1500 bytes.
        </t>
        <section anchor="ip_hdr_size_diff"
                 title="IPv4/IPv6 Header Size Difference">
          <t>
          The IPv6 header is up to 20 bytes larger than the IPv4 header. This
          means that a full-size 1500 bytes large IPv4 packet cannot be
          translated to IPv6 without being fragmented, otherwise it would
          likely have resulted in a 1520 bytes large IPv6 packet.
          </t>
          <t>
          If the transport protocol used is TCP, this is generally not a
          problem, as the IPv6 server will advertise a TCP MSS of 1440 bytes.
          This causes the client to never send larger packets than what can be
          translated to a single full-size IPv6 packet, eliminating any need
          for fragmentation.
          </t>
          <t>
          For other transport protocols, full-size IPv4 packets with the DF
          flag cleared will need to be fragmented by the SIIT-DC Gateway. The
          only way to avoid this is to increase the Path MTU between the
          SIIT-DC Gateway and the servers to 1520 bytes. Note that the
          servers' MTU SHOULD NOT be increased accordingly, as that would
          cause them to undergo Path MTU Discovery for most native IPv6
          destinations. However, the servers would need to be able to accept
          and process incoming packets larger than their own MTU. If the
          server's IPv6 implementation allows the MTU to be set differently
          for specific destinations, it could be increased to 1520 for
          destinations within the Translation Prefix specifically.
          </t>

        <section title="IPv6 Atomic Fragments">
          <t>
          In keeping with <xref target="RFC6145">the fifth paragraph of
          Section 4 of RFC6145</xref>, an SIIT-DC Gateway will by default add
          an IPv6 Fragmentation header to the resulting IPv6 packet when
          translating an IPv4 packet with the Don't Fragment flag set to 0.
          </t>
          <t>
          This happens even though the resulting IPv6 packet isn't actually
          fragmented into several pieces, resulting in an IPv6 Atomic Fragment
          <xref target="RFC6946"/>. These Atomic Fragments are generally not
          useful in a data centre environment, and it is therefore recommended
          that this behaviour is disabled in the SIIT-DC Gateways. To this
          end, <xref target="RFC6145">Section 4 of RFC6145</xref> notes that
          the "translator MAY provide a configuration function that allows the
          translator not to include the Fragment Header for the non-fragmented

        <section title="Minimum Path MTU Difference Between IPv4 and IPv6">
          <t>
          <xref target="RFC2460">Section 5 of RFC2460</xref> specifies that
          the minimum IPv6 link MTU is 1280 bytes. Therefore, an IPv6 node can
          reasonably assume that if it transmits an IPv6 packet that is 1280
          bytes or smaller, it is guaranteed to reach its destination without
          requiring fragmentation or invoking the Path MTU Discovery algorithm
          <xref target="RFC1981"/>. However, this assumption fails if the
          destination is an IPv4 node reached through a protocol translator
          such as an SIIT-DC Gateway, as the minimum IPv4 link MTU is 68
          bytes. See <xref target="RFC0791">Section 3.2 of RFC791</xref>.
          </t>
          <t>
          <xref target="RFC6145">Section 5.1 of RFC6145</xref> specifies that
          an SIIT-DC Gateway should set the IPv4 Don't Fragment flag to 1 when
          it translates an unfragmented IPv6 packet to IPv4. This means that
          when the path to the destination IPv4 node contains an IPv4 link
          with an MTU smaller than 1260 bytes (which corresponds to an IPv6
          MTU smaller than 1280 bytes, cf. <xref target="ip_hdr_size_diff"/>),
          the Path MTU Discovery algorithm will be invoked, even if the
          original IPv6 packet was only 1280 bytes large. This happens as a
          result of the IPv4 router connecting to the IPv4 link with the small
          MTU returning an ICMPv4 Need To Fragment error with an MTU value
          smaller than 1260, which in turns is translated by the SIIT-DC
          Gateway to an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big error with an MTU value smaller
          than 1280 which is then transmitted to the origin IPv6 node.
          </t>
          <t>
          When an IPv6 node receives an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big error indicating
          an MTU value smaller than 1280, <xref target="RFC2460">the last
          paragraph of Section 5 of RFC2460</xref> gives it two choices on how
          to proceed:
          </t>
          <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>It may reduce its Path MTU value to the value indicated in the

            transmitted to that destination to the indicated value. This
            approach causes no problems for the SIIT-DC function, as it simply

            Gateway.</t>
            <t>It may reduce its Path MTU value to exactly 1280, and in
            addition include a Fragmentation header in subsequent packets sent
            to that destination. In other words, the IPv6 node will start
            emitting Atomic Fragments. The Fragmentation header signals to the
            the SIIT-DC Gateway that the Don't Fragment flag should be set to
            0 in the resulting IPv4 packet, and it also provides the
            Identification value.</t>
          </list>
          </t>
          <t>
          If the use of the IPv6 Fragmentation header is problematic, and the
          operator has IPv6 nodes that implement the second option above, the
          operator should consider enabling the functionality described as
          <xref target="RFC6145"> the "second approach" in Section 6 of
          RFC6145</xref>. This functionality changes the SIIT-DC Gateway's
          behaviour as follows:
          </t>
          <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>When translating ICMPv4 Need To Fragment to ICMPv6 Packet Too
            Big, the resulting packet will never contain an MTU value lower
            than 1280. This prevents the IPv6 nodes from generating Atomic
            Fragments.</t>
            <t>When translating IPv6 packets smaller than or equal to 1280
            bytes, the Don't Fragment flag in the resulting IPv4 packet will
            be set to 0. This ensures that in the eventuality that the path
            contains an IPv4 link with an MTU smaller than 1260, the IPv4
            router connected to that link will have the responsibility to
            fragment the packet before forwarding it towards its
            destination.</t>
          </list>
          </t>
          <t>
          In summary, this approach could be seen as prompting the IPv4
          protocol itself to provide the "link-specific fragmentation and
          reassembly at a layer below IPv6" required for links that "cannot
          convey a 1280-octet packet in one piece", to paraphrase <xref
          target="RFC2460">Section 5 of RFC2460</xref>.  Note that <xref
          target="I-D.gont-6man-deprecate-atomfrag-generation"/> seeks to
          update <xref target="RFC6145"/>, making the approach described above
          as the standard and only mode of operation.

    <section anchor="implementation_reqs" title="Implementation Requirements">
      <t>
      This normative section specifies the SIIT-DC protocol that is
      implemented by an SIIT-DC Gateway. Because SIIT-DC builds on and closely
      resembles <xref target="RFC6145">SIIT</xref>, this section should be
      read as a set of additions and changes that are applied to an
      implementation already compliant to <xref target="RFC6145">SIIT</xref>.
      Each of the following subsections discuss how the requirement relates to
      with any corresponding requirements in <xref
      target="RFC6145">SIIT</xref>.
      </t>
      <section title="Compliance with RFC6145 and RFC6052">
        <t>
        Unless otherwise stated in the following sections, an SIIT-DC
        implementation MUST comply fully with <xref target="RFC6145"/>. It
        must also implement the algorithmic address mapping defined in <xref
        target="RFC6052"/>.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Static Address Mapping Function">
        <t>
        The implementation MUST allow the operator to configure an arbitrary
        number of Static Address Mappings which override the default <xref
        target="RFC6052"/> algorithm. It SHOULD be possible to specify a
        single bi-directional mapping that will be used in both the
        IPv4=&gt;IPv6 and IPv6=&gt;IPv4 directions, but it MAY additionally
        (or alternatively) support unidirectional mappings.
        </t>
        <t>
        An example of such a bidirectional Static Address Mapping would be:
        </t>
        <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>192.0.2.1 &lt;=&gt; 2001:db8:12:34::1</t>
        </list>
        </t>
        <t>
        To accomplish the same using unidirectional mappings, the following
        two mappings must instead be configured:
        </t>
        <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>192.0.2.1 =&gt; 2001:db8:12:34::1</t>
          <t>2001:db8:12:34::1 =&gt; 192.0.2.1</t>
        </list>
        </t>
        <t>
        In both cases, if the SIIT-DC Gateway receives an IPv6 packet that has
        the value 2001:db8:12:34::1 in either the source or destination field
        of the IPv6 header, it MUST rewrite this field to 192 0.2.1 when
        translating to IPv4. Similarly, if the SIIT-DC Gateway receives an
        IPv4 packet that has the value 192.0.2.1 as the either the source or
        destination field of the IPv4 header, it MUST rewrite this field to
        2001:db8:12:34::1 when translating to IPv6. For all IPv4 or IPv6
        source or destination field values for which there are no matching
        Static Address Mapping, <xref target="RFC6052"/> compliant mapping
        MUST be used instead.
        </t>
        <t>
        Relation to <xref target="RFC6145"/>: The Static Address Mapping is a
        novel feature feature that is not discussed in <xref
        target="RFC6145"/>. It conflicts with <xref target="RFC6145"/>'s
        requirement that all addresses must be translated according to the
        <xref target="RFC6052"/> algorithm.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="feat_incrv6pmtu"
       title="Support for Increasing the IPv6 Path MTU">
        <t>
        The SIIT-DC Gateway MUST provide a configuration function for the
        network administrator to adjust the threshold of the minimum IPv6 MTU
        to a value that reflects the real value of the minimum IPv6 MTU in the
        network (greater than 1280 bytes). This will help reduce the chance of
        including the Fragment Header in the resulting IPv6 packets.
        </t>
        <t>
        Relation to <xref target="RFC6145"/>: This strengthens the
        corresponding "MAY" requirement located in <xref
        target="RFC6145">Section 4 of RFC6145</xref> to a "MUST".
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Loop Prevention Mechanism">
        <t>
        As noted in <xref target="sec_loops"/>, there is a potential for
        packets looping through the SIIT-DC function if it receives an IPv4
        packet for which there is no Static Address Mapping. It is therefore
        RECOMMENDED that the implementation has a mechanism that automatically
        prevents this behaviour. One way this could be accomplished would be
        to discard any IPv4 packets that would be translated into an IPv6
        packet that would be routed straight back into the SIIT-DC function.
        </t>
        <t>
        If such a mechanism isn't provided, the implementation MUST provide a
        way to manually filter or null-route the destination addresses that
        would otherwise cause loops.
        </t>
        <t>
        Relation to <xref target="RFC6145"/>: This security consideration
        applies only when an SIIT-DC Gateway translates a packet in "pure"
        <xref target="RFC6145">SIIT</xref> mode (i.e., when both address
        fields are translated according to <xref target="RFC6052"/>). This
        consideration is in other words not specific to SIIT-DC, it is
        inherited from <xref target="RFC6145"/>. In spite of this, <xref
        target="RFC6145"/> does not describe this consideration or any methods
        of prevention. The requirements in this section is therefore novel to
        SIIT-DC, even though they apply equally to <xref target="RFC6145"/>.

        <t>
        If a Network-Specific Prefix from the provider's own address space is
        chosen for the translation prefix, as is recommended, care must be
        taken if the translation service is used in front of services that
        have application-level ACLs that distinguish between the operator's
        own networks and the Internet at large, as the translated IPv4 end
        users on the Internet will appear to be located within the provider's
        own IPv6 address space. It is therefore important that the translation
        prefix is treated the same as the Internet at large, rather than as a
        trusted network.
        </t>

      <section anchor="sec_loops"
               title="Packets Looping Through the SIIT-DC Function">
        <t>
        If the SIIT-DC Gateway receives an IPv4 packet destined to an address
        for which there is no Static Address Mapping, its destination address
        will be rewritten according to <xref target="RFC6052"/>, making the
        resulting IPv6 packet have a destination address within the
        translation prefix, which is likely routed to back to the SIIT-DC
        function. This will cause the packet to loop until its Time To Live /
        Hop Limit reaches zero, potentially creating a Denial Of Service
        vulnerability.
        </t>
        <t>
        To avoid this, it should be ensured that packets sent to IPv4
        destinations addresses for which there are no Static Address Mappings,
        or whose resulting IPv6 address does not have a more-specific route to
        the IPv6 network, are immediately discarded.

    <section title="Complete SIIT-DC topology example">
      <t>
      This figure shows a more complete SIIT-DC topology, in order to better
      demonstrate the beneficial properties it has. In particular, it tries to
      highlight the following:
      </t>
      <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Stateless operation: Any number of SIIT-DC Gateways may be deployed
        side-by side, or indeed anywhere in the IPv6 network, as any standard
        routing mechanism may be used to direct traffic to them (shown here
        with BGP on the IPv4 side and ECMP on the IPv6 side). This in turn
        leads to high availability, should one of the SIIT-DC Gateways fail or
        become unavailable, those standard routing mechanisms will ensure that
        traffic is automatically redirect one of the remaining SIIT-DC
        Gateways.</t>
        <t>IPv4 address conservation: Even though the to customers in the
        example have several hundred servers, most of them are not used for
        externally available services, and thus do not require an IPv4
        address. The network between the servers and the SIIT-DC Gateways
        require no IPv4 addresses, either. Furthermore, the IPv4 addresses
        that are used do not have to be assigned to customers in the form of
        aggregated blocks or prefixes; which makes it easy to achieve 100%
        effective utilisation of the IPv4 service address pools.</t>
        <t>Application support: The translation-friendly applications HTTP and
        SMTP will work through SIIT-DC without requiring any special
        customisation. Furthermore, translation-unfriendly applications such
        as FTP will also work if an host agent in present, cf.  <xref
        target="I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat"/>.</t>
        <t>Native IPv6 as the foundation: Every server, application, and
        network component has access to native and untranslated IPv6
        connectivity to each other and to the Internet. Traffic through the
        SIIT-DC Gateways will diminish over time as IPv6 is deployed
        throughout the Internet. Eventually they may be shut down entirely,
        which causes no disruption to the application stacks' ability to
        deliver their services over native IPv6.</t>

      There are a number of alternative deployment strategies a data centre
      operator may follow. They each have different properties and helps solve

        At the time of writing, IPv4-only operation remains the status quo for

        target="RFC3022">NAPT44</xref> devices which will translate between a
        smaller number of public IPv4 addresses and the private addresses
        assigned to the servers that provide public services to the Internet.

        </list>
        </t>
        <t>
        In addition, application compatibility is a consideration with both
        NAPT44 and SIIT-DC, but the exact nature depends from application to
        application, so it is hard to objectively quantify if there is a clear
        advantage to either approach here. Some translation-unfriendly
        application protocols may work without host modifications through the
        use of Application Layer Gateway support in the NAPT44 device (e.g.,
        <xref target="RFC0959">FTP</xref>), or in the SIIT-DC architecture
        when a host agent is being used <xref
        target="I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat"/>.  Other application
        protocols might not work with NAPT44 at all, but will work in the
        SIIT-DC if a host agent is being used (e.g., <xref
        target="RFC4217">FTP/TLS</xref>).
        </t>
        <t>
        In summary, the most accurate statement would be to say that an NAPT44
        architecture is more compatible with translation-unfriendly protocols
        than plain SIIT-DC, while SIIT-DC is more compatible than NAPT44 if a
        host agent is used.

        <t>
        An operator who would otherwise chose a traditional IPv4-only
        approach, but would in addition like to provide service availability
        for IPv6 end users, could use <xref target="RFC6146">Stateful
        NAT64</xref> to accomplish this. In a sense, this would be the mirror
        image of an SIIT-DC architecture: The infrastructure and servers
        remains single-stacked, while connectivity to the other IP stack is
        provided through a translation system. Further information about
        operating Stateful NAT64 is found in <xref target="RFC7269"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
        Note that Stateful NAT64 can be deployed with or without NAPT44. With
        the exception that IPv6 service availability is being provided, the
        discussion in the previous two sections fully applies to an IPv4-only
        environment that includes NAT64.

          environment "is only reasonable at an early stage". With SIIT-DC,
          the inverse is true; the traffic levels on the SIIT-DC Gateways will
          decrease over time, as end users will prefer to use native IPv6 once
          it is available to them.</t>
