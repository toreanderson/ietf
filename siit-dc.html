  <h1 id="rfc.section.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">This document describes the use of <a href="#RFC6145">SIIT</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC6145]</cite> as a network-centric stateless translation service that allows a data centre operator or Internet Content Provider (ICP) to run a data centre network, servers, and applications using exclusively IPv6, while at the same time ensuring that end users that have only IPv4 connectivity will be able to continue to access the services and applications.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> Motivation and Goals</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">Historically, <a href="#RFC4213">dual stack</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4213]</cite> has been the recommended way to transition from an IPv4-only environment to one capable of serving IPv6 users. For data centre and Internet content providers, dual stack operation has a number of disadvantages compared to single stack operation. In particular, the increased complexity and operational overhead, and very low expected return of investment in the short to medium term, as there are practically no end-users who have only connectivity to the IPv6 Internet. Furthermore, the dual stack approach does not in any way help with the depletion of the IPv4 address space.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.2">Therefore, a better approach is needed. The design goals are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Promote the deployment of native IPv6 services (cf. <a href="#RFC6540">[RFC6540]</a>).</li>
  <li>Provide IPv4 service availability for legacy users with no loss of performance or functionality.</li>
  <li>To ensure that that the legacy users' IPv4 addresses remain available to the servers and applications.</li>
  <li>To conserve and maximise the utilisation of IPv4 addresses.</li>
  <li>To avoid introducing more complexity than absolutely necessary, especially on the servers and applications.</li>
  <li>To be easy to scale and deploy in a fault-tolerant manner.</li>
</ul>

<p> The following subsections elaborates on how SIIT meets these goals.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1.1">1.1.1.</a> Single Stack IPv6 Operation</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.1.p.1">SIIT allows an operator to build their applications on an IPv6-only foundation. IPv4 end-user connectivity becomes a service provided by the network, which systems administration and application development staff do not need to concern themselves with.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.1.p.2">Obviously, this will promote universal IPv6 deployment for all of the provider's services and applications.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.1.p.3">It is worth noting that SIIT-DC requires no special support or change from the underlying IPv6 infrastructure, it will work with any kind of IPv6 network. Traffic between IPv6-enabled end users and IPv6-enabled services will always be native, and SIIT-DC will not be involved in it at all.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1.2"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1.2">1.1.2.</a> Stateless Operation</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.2.p.1">Unlike other solutions that provide either dual stack availability to single-stack services (e.g., <a href="#RFC6146">Stateful NAT64</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC6146]</cite> and Layer-4/7 proxies), or that provide conservation of IPv4 addresses (e.g., <a href="#RFC3022">NAPT44</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC3022]</cite>), a SIIT Gateway does not keep any state between each packet in a single connection or flow. In this sense it operates exactly like a normal IP router, and has similar scaling properties - the limiting factors are packets per second and bandwidth. The number of concurrent flows and flow initiation rates are irrelevant for performance.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.2.p.2">This not only allows individual SIIT Gateways to easily attain "line rate" performance, it also allows for per-packet load balancing between multiple SIIT Gateways using <a href="#RFC2991">Equal-Cost Multipath Routing</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC2991]</cite>. Asymmetric routing is also acceptable, which makes it easy to avoid sub-optimal traffic patterns; the prefixes involved may be anycasted from all the SIIT Gateways in the provider's network, thus ensuring that the most optimal path through the network is used, even the optimal path in one direction differs from the optimal path in the opposite direction.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.2.p.3">Finally, stateless operation means that high availability is easily achieved. If an SIIT Gateway should fail, its traffic can be re-routed onto another SIIT Gateway using a standard IP routing protocol. This does not impact existing flows any more than what any other IP re-routing event would.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1.3"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1.3">1.1.3.</a> No Loss of End User's Source Address</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.3.p.1">SIIT will map the entire end-user's source address into an predefined IPv6 translation prefix. This allows the application server to identify the user by an IPv4 address, which is useful for performing tasks like Geo-Location, logging, abuse handling, and so forth.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1.4"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1.4">1.1.4.</a> No Forklift Upgrades Required</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.4.p.1">Except for the introduction of the SIIT Gateways themselves, there is no change required in the network, servers, applications, or anywhere else to specifically support SIIT, compared to a dual stack deployment. From the clients', the servers', the IPv6 data centre network's, and the IPv4 Internet's point of view, SIIT is practically invisible. It will work with any standards-compliant IPv4 or IPv6 stack.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1.5"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1.5">1.1.5.</a> No Architectural Dependency on IPv4</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.5.p.1">SIIT will allow an ICP or data centre operator to build infrastructure and applications entirely on IPv6. This means that when the day comes to discontinue support for IPv4, no change needs to be made to the overall architecture - it's only a matter of shutting off the SIIT Gateways. Therefore, by deploying native IPv6 along with SIIT, operators will avoid future migration or deployment projects relating to IPv6 roll-out and/or IPv4 sun-setting.  </p>

<dl>
  <dt>IPv4 Service Address</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">A public IPv4 address with which IPv4-only clients will communicate. This communication will be translated to IPv6 by the SIIT Gateway.</dd>
  <dt>IPv4 Service Address Pool</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">One or more IPv4 prefixes routed to the SIIT Gateway's IPv4 interface. IPv4 Service Addresses are allocated from this pool. Note that this does not necessarily have to be a "pool" per se, as it could also be one or more host routes (whose prefix length is equal to /32). The primary purpose of using a pool rather than host routes is to facilitate IPv4 route aggregation and ease provisioning of new IPv4 Service Addresses.</dd>
  <dt>IPv6 Service Address</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">A public IPv6 address assigned to a server or application in the IPv6 network. IPv6-only and dual stacked clients communicates with this address directly without invoking SIIT.  IPv4-only clients also communicates with this address through the SIIT Gateway and via an IPv4 Service Address.</dd>
  <dt>SIIT Host Agent</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">A logical function very similar to an SIIT Gateway that resides on a server and provides virtual IPv4 connectivity to applications, by performing <a href="#RFC6145">[RFC6145]</a> translation on packets passing through it.

  <dt>Static Address Mapping</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">A bi-directional mapping between an IPv4 Service Address and an IPv6 Service Address configured in the SIIT Gateway.

  <dt>Translation Prefix</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">An IPv6 prefix into which the entire IPv4 address space is mapped. This prefix is routed to the SIIT Gateway's IPv6 interface. It is either an Network-Specific Prefix or a Well-Known Prefix as specified in <a href="#RFC6052">[RFC6052]</a>. When translating between IPv4 and IPv6, the SIIT Gateway prepends or strips the Translation Prefix from the address fields in the translated packet's IP header, unless a Static Address Mapping exists for the IP address in question.</dd>

<h1 id="rfc.section.4"><a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> Deployment Guidelines</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">In this section, we list recommendations and guidelines for operators who would like to deploy a SIIT-DC service in their data centre network.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1"><a href="#rfc.section.4.1">4.1.</a> Application Support for NAT</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.1">Not all application protocols are able to operate in a network environment where rewriting of IP addresses occur. An operator should therefore carefully evaluate the applications he would like to make available for IPv4 users through SIIT, to ensure they do not fall in this category. In general, if an application layer protocol works correctly through standard NAT44 (see <a href="#RFC3235">[RFC3235]</a>), it will most likely work correctly through SIIT as well.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">Higher-level protocols that embed IP addresses as part of their payload are especially problematic, as noted in <a href="#RFC2663">[RFC2663]</a>, <a href="#RFC2993">[RFC2993]</a>, and <a href="#RFC3022">[RFC3022]</a>. Such protocols will most likely not work through any form of address translation, including SIIT. One well-known example of such a protocol is <a href="#RFC0959">FTP</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC0959]</cite>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.3">The SIIT-DC architecture may be extended with a Host Agent that reverses the translation performed by the SIIT Gateway before passing the packets to the application software, such applications protocols will be able to work correctly in an SIIT environment as well. See <a href="#I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat">[I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat]</a> for a description of this extension.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2"><a href="#rfc.section.4.2">4.2.</a> Application Support for IPv6</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">SIIT-DC requires that the application software supports IPv6 networking, and that it has no dependency on IPv4 networking. If this is not the case, the approach described in <a href="#I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat">[I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat]</a> may be used, as it provides the application with seemingly native IPv4 connectivity.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.3"><a href="#rfc.section.4.3">4.3.</a> Application Communication Pattern</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.1">SIIT-DC is ideally suited for applications where IPv4-only nodes on the Internet initiate traffic towards the IPv6-only services, which in turn are only passively listening for inbound traffic and responding as necessary. One well-known example of such a protocol is  <a href="#RFC2616">HTTP</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC2616]</cite>. This is due to the fact that in this case, an IPv4 user looks exactly like an ordinary IPv6 user from the host and application's point of view, and requires no special treatment.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.2">It is possible to combine SIIT with <a href="#RFC6147">DNS64</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC6147]</cite> in order to allow an IPv6-only application to initiate communication with IPv4-only nodes through an SIIT Gateway. However, in this case, care must be taken so that all outgoing communication is sourced from the IPv6 Service Address that has a Static Mapping configured on the SIIT Gateway. If another unmapped address is used, the SIIT Gateway will discard the packet.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.3">An alternative approach to the above would be to make use of an SIIT Host Agent as described in <a href="#I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat">[I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat]</a>. This provides the application with seemingly native IPv4 connectivity, which it may use for both inbound and outbound communication without requiring the application to select a specific source address for its outbound communications.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.4"><a href="#rfc.section.4.4">4.4.</a> Choice of Translation Prefix</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.1">Either a Network-Specific Prefix (NSP) from the provider's own IPv6 address space or the IANA-allocated Well-Known Prefix 64:ff9b::/96 (WKP) may be used. From a technical point of view, both should work equally well, however as only a single WKP exists, if a provider would like to deploy more than one instance of SIIT in his network, or <a href="#RFC6146">Stateful NAT64</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC6146]</cite>, an NSP must be used anyway for all but one of those deployments.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.2">Furthermore, the WKP cannot be used in inter-domain routing. By using an NSP, a provider will have the possibility to provide SIIT service to other operators across Autonomous System borders.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.3">For these reasons, this document recommends that an NSP is used.  Section 3.3 of <a href="#RFC6052">[RFC6052]</a> discusses the choice of translation prefix in more detail.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.4">The Translation Prefix may use any of the lengths described in <a href="#RFC6052">Section 2.2 of RFC6052</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC6052]</cite>, but /96 has two distinct advantages over the others. First, converting it to IPv4 can be done in a single operation by simply stripping off the first 96 bits; second, it allows for IPv4 addresses to be embedded directly into the text representation of an IPv6 address using the familiar dotted quad notation, e.g., "2001:db8::192.0.2.10" (cf. <a href="#RFC6052">Section 2.4 of RFC6052</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC6052]</cite>)), instead of being converted to hexadecimal notation. This makes it easier to write IPV6 ACLs and similar that match translated endpoints in the IPv4 Internet.  Use of a /96 prefix length is therefore recommended.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.5"><a href="#rfc.section.4.5">4.5.</a> Routing Considerations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.1">The prefixes that constitute the IPv4 Service Address Pool and the IPv6 Translation Prefix may be routed to the SIIT Gateway(s) as any other IPv4 or IPv6 route in the provider's network.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.2">If more than one SIIT Gateway is being deployed, it is recommended that a dynamic routing protocol (such as BGP, IS-IS, or OSPF) is being used to advertise the routes within the provider's network. This will ensure that the traffic that is to be translated will reach the closest SIIT Gateway, reducing or eliminating sub-optimal traffic patterns, as well as provide high availability - if one SIIT Gateway fails, the dynamic routing protocol will automatically redirect the traffic to the next-best translator.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.6"><a href="#rfc.section.4.6">4.6.</a> Location of the SIIT Gateways</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.1">It is optimal to place the SIIT Gateways as close as possible to the direct path between the servers and the end users. If the closest translator is located a long way from the optimal path, all packets in both directions must make a detour. This would increase the RTT between the server and the end user by by two times the extra latency incurred by the detour, as well as cause unnecessary load on the network links on the detour path.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.2">The ideal location of the SIIT Gateways would be a logical function within the IP routers would have handled the traffic anyway (if the topology was dual stacked) This way, the translation service would not need separate networks ports to be assigned (which might become saturated and impact the service quality), nor would it need extra rack space or energy. Some good choices of the location could be within a data centre's access routers, or inside the provider's border routers. If every single application in the data centre or the provider's network eventually get single-stacked, there would no need to run IPv4 on the inside of the SIIT Gateway - thus allowing the operator to reclaim IPv4 addresses from the network infrastructure that may instead be used for translated services.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.7"><a href="#rfc.section.4.7">4.7.</a> Migration from Dual Stack</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.7.p.1">While this document discusses the use of IPv6-only servers and applications, there is no technical requirement that the servers are IPv4 free. SIIT-DC works equally well for dual stacked servers, which makes migration easy - after setting up the translation function, the DNS A record for the service is updated to point to the IPv4 address that will be translated to IPv6, the previously used IPv4 service address may continue to be assigned to the server. This makes roll-back to dual stack easy, as it is only a matter of changing the DNS record back to what it was before.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.7.p.2">For high-volume services migrating to SIIT-DC from dual stack, DNS Round Robin may be used to gradually migrate the service's IPv4 traffic from its native IPv4 address(es) to the translated IPv4 Service Address(s).  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.8"><a href="#rfc.section.4.8">4.8.</a> Packet Size and Fragmentation Considerations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.8.p.1">There are two key differences between IPv4 and IPv6 relating to packet sizes that one should consider when deploying SIIT-DC. They result in a few problematic corner cases, which can be dealt with in a few different ways.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.8.p.2">The operator may find that relying on fragmentation in the IPv6 domain is undesired or even operationally impossible <a href="#I-D.taylor-v6ops-fragdrop">[I-D.taylor-v6ops-fragdrop]</a>.  For this reason, the recommendations in this section seeks to minimise the use of IPv6 fragmentation.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.8.p.3">Unless otherwise stated, this section assumes that the MTU in both the IPv4 and IPv6 domains is 1500 bytes.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.8.1"><a href="#rfc.section.4.8.1">4.8.1.</a> IP Header Size Difference</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.8.1.p.1">The IPv6 header is up to 20 bytes larger than the IPv4 header. This means that a full-size 1500 bytes large IPv4 packet cannot be translated to IPv6 without being fragmented, otherwise it would likely have resulted in a 1520 bytes large IPv6 packet.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.8.1.p.2">If the transport protocol used is TCP, this is generally not a problem, as the IPv6 server will advertise a TCP MSS of 1440 bytes.  This causes the client to never send larger packets than what can be translated to a single full-size IPv6 packet, eliminating any need for fragmentation.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.8.1.p.3">For other transport protocols, full-size IPv4 packets with the DF flag cleared will need to be fragmented by the SIIT Gateway. The only way to avoid this is to increase the Path MTU between the SIIT Gateway and the servers to 1520 bytes. Note that the servers' MTU SHOULD NOT be increased accordingly, as that would cause them to undergo Path MTU Discovery for most native IPv6 destinations.  However, the servers would need to be able to accept and process incoming packets larger than their own MTU. However, if the server's IPv6 implementation allows the MTU to be set differently for specific destinations, it could be increased to 1520 for destinations within the Translation Prefix specifically.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.8.2"><a href="#rfc.section.4.8.2">4.8.2.</a> Minimum Path MTU Difference</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.8.2.p.1">The minimum allowed link MTU in IPv6 is 1280 bytes. In IPv4, the corresponding value is 68 bytes. This means that an 1280 byte large IPv6 packet sent to an IPv4 client may need to be fragmented by a router in the IPv4 network, if the path to the IPv4 client involves a link with a MTU lower than 1260 bytes.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.8.2.p.2">By default, an SIIT Gateway will set the DF flag when translating from IPv6 to IPv4, resulting in a situation where the IPv6 server may receive an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big error where the indicated MTU value is less than the IPv6 minimum of 1280. In this situation, the IPv6 server has two choices on how to proceed, according to the last paragraph of <a href="#RFC2460">Section 5 of RFC2460</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC2460]</cite>: </p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>It may reduce its Path MTU value to the value indicated in the Packet Too Big. This causes no problems for the SIIT function.</li>
  <li>It may reduce its Path MTU value to exactly 1280, and also include a Fragmentation header in each subsequent packet sent to that destination. The Fragmentation header signals to the the SIIT Gateway that the DF flag should be cleared in the resulting IPv4 packet, and it also provides the Identification value.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.8.2.p.4">If the use of the IPv6 Fragmentation header is problematic, and the operator has IPv6 servers that implement the second option above, the operator should enable a feature on the SIIT Gateways which ensures that the resulting MTU field is always set to 1280 or higher when translating ICMPv4 Need to Fragment into ICMPv6 Packet Too Big, and that when translating IPv6 packets smaller or equal to 1280 bytes the resulting IPv4 packets will have the DF flag cleared and an Identification value generated, cf. <a href="#feat_smallv4pmtu">Section 5.5</a>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.8.3"><a href="#rfc.section.4.8.3">4.8.3.</a> "Atomic Fragments"</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.8.3.p.1">By default, an SIIT Gateway will include a Fragmentation header in the resulting IPv6 packet when translating from an IPv4 packet with the DF flag cleared, cf. <a href="#RFC6145">Section 4 of RFC6145</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC6145]</cite>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.8.3.p.2">This happens even though the resulting IPv6 packet isn't actually fragmented into several pieces, resulting in an "Atomic Fragment" <a href="#RFC6946">[RFC6946]</a>. This is generally not useful in a data centre environment, and it is therefore recommended that this behaviour is disabled in the SIIT Gateway(s). See <a href="#feat_noatomicfrags">Section 5.4</a>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5"><a href="#rfc.section.5">5.</a> <a href="#implementation_reqs" id="implementation_reqs">Implementation Requirements</a></h1>
<p><a href="#RFC6145">[RFC6145]</a> and <a href="#RFC6052">[RFC6052]</a> specifies the basic SIIT Gateway. However, they specify some optional features that are very desirable when deploying SIIT in a data centre environment.  This section list which additional features are required for an SIIT Gateway optimised for a data centre environment.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.1"><a href="#rfc.section.5.1">5.1.</a> Basic Requirements</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.1">The implementation MUST implement <a href="#RFC6145">[RFC6145]</a> with the algorithmic address mapping defined in <a href="#RFC6052">[RFC6052]</a>. It MUST NOT create any per-session state under any circumstance.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.2"><a href="#rfc.section.5.2">5.2.</a> Static Address Mapping Function</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.1">The implementation MUST allow the operator to configure an arbitrary number of Static Address Mappings which override the default <a href="#RFC6052">[RFC6052]</a> algorithm. It SHOULD be possible to specify a single bi-directional mapping that will be used in both the IPv4=&gt;IPv6 and IPv6=&gt;IPv4 directions, but it MAY additionally (or alternatively) support unidirectional mappings.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.2">An example of such a bidirectional Static Address Mapping would be: <a href="#RFC6052">[RFC6052]</a> mapping MUST be used.  </p>

<ul>
  <li>198.51.0.1 &lt;=&gt; 2001:db8:12:34::1</li>
</ul>

<p> To accomplish the same using unidirectional mappings, the following two mappings must instead be configured: </p>

<ul>
  <li>198.51.0.1 =&gt; 2001:db8:12:34::1</li>
  <li>2001:db8:12:34::1 =&gt; 198.51.0.1</li>
</ul>

<p> In both cases, if the SIIT Gateway receives an IPv6 packet that has 2001:db8:12:34::c in either of the source and destination fields of the IP header, it MUST rewrite this field to 198.51.0.1 when translating to IPv4. Similarly, if the SIIT Gateway receives an IPv4 packet that has 198.51.0.1 as the either the source or destination fields of the IP header, it MUST rewrite this field to 2001:db8:12:34::c. For all IPv4 or IPv6 source or destination field values for which there is no Static Address Mapping, </p>

Also see <a href="#I-D.gont-6man-deprecate-atomfrag-generation">[I-D.gont-6man-deprecate-atomfrag-generation]</a>, which seeks to update <a href="#RFC6145">[RFC6145]</a> with the approach described above.  </p>

<ul>
  <li>When translating an ICMPv4 Need To Fragment packet indicating a Path MTU smaller than or equal to 1260, the MTU field in the resulting ICMPv6 Packet Too Big is set to 1280.</li>
  <li>When translating an IPv6 packet that is smaller or equal to 1280 bytes, the DF flag in the resulting IPv4 packet is cleared, and an Identification value is set to a random number. The translator MUST NOT generate any state as a result of this.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.1">As noted in <a href="#sec_loops">Section 9.2</a>, there is a potential for packets looping through the SIIT function if it receives an IPv4 packet for which there is no Static Address Mapping.

<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.1">If a Network-Specific Prefix from the provider's own address space is chosen for the translation prefix, as is recommended, care must be taken if the translation service is used in front of services that have application-level ACLs that distinguish between the operator's own networks and the Internet at large, as the translated IPv4 end users on the Internet will appear to come from within the provider's own IPv6 address space.

<h1 id="rfc.appendix.A"><a href="#rfc.appendix.A">Appendix A.</a> Complete SIIT topology example</h1>
<div id="rfc.figure.7"/>
<div id="fig_topology"/>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.1">This figure shows a more complete SIIT-DC topology, in order to better demonstrate the beneficial properties it has. In particular, it tries to highlight the following: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Stateless operation: Any number of SIIT Gateways may be deployed side-by side, or indeed anywhere in the IPv6 network, as any standard routing mechanism may be used to direct traffic to them (shown here with BGP on the IPv4 side and ECMP on the IPv6 side). This in turn leads to high availability, should one of the SIIT Gateways fail or become unavailable, those standard routing mechanisms will ensure that traffic is automatically redirect one of the remaining SIIT Gateways.</li>
  <li>IPv4 address conservation: Even though the to customers in the example have several hundred servers, most of them are not used for externally available services, and thus do not require an IPv4 address. The network between the servers and the SIIT Gateways require no IPv4 addresses, either. Furthermore, the IPv4 addresses that are used do not have to be assigned to customers in the form of aggregated blocks or prefixes; which makes it easy to achieve 100% effective utilisation of the IPv4 service address pools.</li>
  <li>Application support: The translation-friendly applications HTTP and SMTP will work through SIIT without requiring any special customisation. Furthermore, translation-unfriendly applications such as FTP will also work if an host agent in present, cf.  <a href="#I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat">[I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat]</a>.</li>
  <li>Native IPv6 as the foundation: Every server, application, and network component has access to native and untranslated IPv6 connectivity to each other and to the Internet. Traffic through the SIIT Gateways will diminish over time as IPv6 is deployed throughout the Internet. Eventually they may be shut down entirely, which causes no disruption to the application stacks' ability to deliver their services over native IPv6.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="rfc.appendix.B"><a href="#rfc.appendix.B">Appendix B.</a> Comparison to Other Deployment Approaches</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.1">There are a number of alternative deployment strategies a data centre operator may follow. They each have different properties and helps solve a different set of challenges. This section aims to compare the SIIT-DC approach with each of the most common ones, by highlighting the benefits and disadvantages of each.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.B.1"><a href="#rfc.appendix.B.1">B.1.</a> IPv4-only</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.B.1.p.1">At the time of writing, IPv4-only operation remains the status quo for most operators. As such, it is well understood and supported. An operator can reasonably expect everything to work correctly in an IPv4-only environment.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.1.p.2">Benefits of IPv4-only operation compared to SIIT-DC include: </p>

<ul>
  <li>No translation occurs, the end-to-end principle is intact.</li>
  <li>Compatible with all common application protocols.</li>
  <li>Compatible with IPv4-only devices.</li>
  <li>Compatible with IPv4-only application software, without requiring a host agent.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.1.p.3">Disadvantages of IPv4-only operation compared to SIIT-DC include: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Does not provide any form of IPv6 connectivity.</li>
  <li>Does not alleviate IPv4 address scarcity.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.B.2"><a href="#rfc.appendix.B.2">B.2.</a> IPv4-only + NAPT44</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.B.2.p.1">An operator who would otherwise chose a traditional IPv4-only approach, but cannot due to having insufficient public IPv4 addresses available, could chose to deploy using a combination of <a href="#RFC1918">private IPv4 addresses</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC1918]</cite> and <a href="#RFC3022">NAPT44</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC3022]</cite> devices which will translate between a smaller number of public IPv4 addresses and the private addresses assigned to the servers that provide public services to the Internet.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.2.p.2">Benefits of IPv4-only + NAPT44 operation compared to SIIT-DC include: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Compatible with IPv4-only devices.</li>
  <li>Compatible with IPv4-only application software, without requiring a host agent.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.2.p.3">Disadvantages of IPv4-only + NAPT44 operation compared to SIIT-DC include: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Does not provide any form of IPv6 availability.</li>
  <li>Requires network devices that track all flow state, which may create a performance bottleneck and be an easy target for Denial of Service attacks.</li>
  <li>Limits routing flexibility (prevents closest exit routing), as outbound traffic must pass across the same NAPT44 device that handled the inbound traffic.</li>
  <li>Limited potential for horizontal scaling, as packets cannot be load-balanced across multiple NAT devices.</li>
  <li>Depending on whether or not the NAPT44 device rewrites source addresses in order to attract the return traffic to itself: <ul><li>Obscures the true source address of the user from the server/application, preventing it from e.g. performing geo-location lookups, or:</li><li>Requires an IPv4 default route to be pointed to the NAPT44 device, also attracting native traffic that does not need to undergo translation.</li></ul><p> </p></li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.2.p.4">In addition, application compatibility is a consideration with both NAPT44 and SIIT-DC, but the exact nature depends from application to application, so it is hard to objectively quantify if there is a clear advantage to either approach here. Some translation-unfriendly application protocols may work without host modifications through the use of Application Layer Gateway support in the NAPT44 device (e.g., <a href="#RFC0959">FTP</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC0959]</cite>), or in the SIIT-DC architecture when a host agent is being used <a href="#I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat">[I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat]</a>.  Other application protocols might not work with NAPT44 at all, but will work in the SIIT-DC if a host agent is being used (e.g., <a href="#RFC4217">FTP/TLS</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4217]</cite>).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.2.p.5">In summary, the most accurate statement would be to say that a NAPT44 architecture is more compatible with translation-unfriendly protocols than plain SIIT-DC, while SIIT-DC is more compatible than NAPT44 if a host agent is used.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.2.p.6">For a more complete discussion of potential issues with running NAPT44, see <a href="#RFC2993">Architectural Implications of NAT</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC2993]</cite>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.B.3"><a href="#rfc.appendix.B.3">B.3.</a> Dual Stack</h1>
<p><a href="#RFC4213">Dual Stack</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4213]</cite> could be used both with or without NAPT44 to handle IPv4. In general, the benefits and disadvantages are equal to the corresponding IPv4-only option, except for the fact that Dual Stack does provides IPv6 connectivity.  Therefore, his section only lists the benefits and disadvantages which are unique to a Dual Stack environment.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.3.p.2">Benefits of Dual Stack operation compared to SIIT-DC include: </p>

<ul>
  <li>No translation occurring, the end-to-end principle is intact (assuming NAPT44 isn't used).</li>
  <li>Compatible with all common application protocols (assuming NAPT44 isn't used).</li>
  <li>Compatible with IPv4-only devices.</li>
  <li>Compatible with IPv4-only application software, without requiring a host agent.</li>
</ul>

<p> Disadvantages of Dual Stack operation compared to SIIT-DC include: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Does not alleviate IPv4 address scarcity (assuming NAPT44 isn't used).</li>
  <li>Increases the complexity of the infrastructure, as many things must done twice (once for IPv4 and once for IPv6). Examples of things that must be duplicated in this manner under Dual Stack: Firewall rules/ACLs, IGP topology, monitoring, troubleshooting.</li>
  <li>Encourages software developers, systems administrators, etc. to build architectures that cannot operate correctly without IPv4. This in turn makes it difficult to make use of Dual Stack as a short term transitional stage, rather than a near-permanent end state.</li>
  <li>Increases the amount of things that can encounter failures, and increases the time required to locate and fix such failures. This reduces reliability.</li>
</ul>
