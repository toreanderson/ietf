      <xref target="RFC6052"/> reserves the IPv6 prefix 64:ff9b::/96 for use
      with IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanisms using the stateless IP address
      translation algorithm specified in the same document.
      </t>
      <t>
      This document extends this reservation to 64::/16. This facilitates the
      co-existence of multiple IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanisms in the same
      network without requiring the use of a Network-Specific Prefix.

      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="problem_statement" title="Problem Statement">
      <t>
      Since the WKP 64:ff9b::/96 was reserved by <xref target="RFC6052"/>,
      several new IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanisms have been defined by the
      IETF. These target various different use cases. An operator might
      therefore wish to make use of several of them simultaneously.
      </t>
      <t>
      The smallest possible prefix supported by the <xref target="RFC6052"/>
      algorithm is a /96. Because the WKP is a /96, an operator preferring to
      use a WKP over an NSP can only do so for only one of his IPv4/IPv6
      translation mechanisms. All others must necessarily use an NSP.
      </t>
      <t>
      The WKP is reserved specifically for use with the algorithm specified in
      <xref target="RFC6052"/>. More recent IETF documents describe IPv4/IPv6
      translation mechanisms that use different algorithms. An operator
      deploying such mechanisms can not use of the WKP in a legitimate
      fashion.
      </t>
      <t>
      Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC6052"/> imposes certain restrictions on
      the use of the WKP. These restrictions might conflict with the
      operator's desired use of an IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanism.
      </t>
      <t>
      In summary, there is a need for a prefix that facilitates the
      co-existence of multiple IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanisms (that do not
      necessarily use the <xref target="RFC6052"/> algorithm).
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="choice" title="Choosing 64::/16">
      <t>
      The prefix described in this document is intended as a generic
      reservation that may be used for all present and future IPv4/IPv6
      translation mechanisms, including the one described in <xref
      target="RFC6052"/>. Therefore, in order to prevent needless
      fragmentation of the IPv6 address space, it is prudent to choose a
      prefix that encompasses the <xref target="RFC6052"/> WKP.
      </t>
      <t>
      The <xref target="RFC6052"/> algorithm specifies possible prefix lengths
      as short as /32. As previously discussed in <xref
      target="problem_statement"/>, this document intends to facilitate
      simultaneous operation of multiple IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanisms in a
      single network. This means that the reservation must necessarily have a
      prefix length shorter than /32. Furthermore, as IPv6 addresses are
      divided into groups of 16 bits each, it is natural to use a prefix
      length that aligns with a 16-bit boundary.
      </t>
      <t>
      Taking all the above considerations account, the only possible prefix
      value remaining is 64::/16.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="deployment" title="Deployment Considerations">
      <t>
      64::/16 is intended as a technology-agnostic and generic reservation. A
      network operator may freely use it in combination with any IPv4/IPv6
      translation mechanism deployed within his network.
      </t>
      <t>
      By default, IPv6 nodes and applications must not treat IPv6 addresses
      within 64::/16 and outside 64:ff9b::/96 different from other globally
      scoped IPv6 addresses. In particular, they must not make any
      assumptions regarding the syntax or properties of those addresses (e.g.,
      the existence and location of embedded IPv4 addresses), or the type of
      associated translation mechanism (e.g., whether it is stateful or
      stateless).
      </t>
      <t>
      64:ff9b::/96 may only be used according to <xref target="RFC6052"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
      64::/16 or any other more-specific prefix may not be advertised in
      inter-domain routing, except by explicit agreement between all involved
      parties. Such prefixes MUST NOT be advertised to the default-free zone.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
      The IANA is requested to reserve the IPv6 prefix 64::/16 for use with
      IPv4/IPv6 translation.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
      The reservation of 64::/16 is not known to cause any new security
      considerations beyond those documented in Section 5 of <xref
      target="RFC6052"/>.
